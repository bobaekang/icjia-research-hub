One effective model for addressing street violence, and, in particular, gang-related or group-involved street violence, is the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention’s (OJJDP) Comprehensive Gang Prevention, Intervention, and Suppression Model. The model involves implementing complementary and coordinated prevention, intervention, and suppression activities in a single community. This article provides examples of evidence-based practices and programs that strengthen youth resilience and build social capital and work to reduce threats or perceived threats using the OJJDP model as a framework. The article also highlights how the model is enhanced when community stakeholders consider how trauma has impacted residents and those targeted by intervention and suppression efforts.","showTeaser":false},{"title":"Study of Self-Reported Prescription Drug Use Among a Sample of Illinois Prisoners","splash":"/assets/img/splash/drugs-spilled-out-gm.jpg","authors":["Lily Gleicher","Jessica Reichert","Dustin Cantrell"],"pubtype":["Article"],"area":["Substance use disorders","corrections","prison","prescription drug use"],"date":"2017-06-15","filename":"study-of-self-reported-prescription-drug-use-among-a-sample-of-illinois-prisoners","teaser":"While more than half of individuals incarcerated in U.S. jails and prisons meet the diagnostic criteria for a substance use disorder, little is known about their misuse of prescription drugs.
